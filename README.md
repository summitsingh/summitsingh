:computer: I have always had a deep passion for technology. When I first came here from India, I was enraptured in a startup's life from a young age.

At [TruckBux](https://truckbux.com), Iâ€™m the brain behind our tech & oversee all product innovation. I lead our team of developers, making aggressive strides toward product perfection. Throughout my years, I've built several products, along with experience in Oracle. I know how to lead and create synergies between our products and customers. I understand specifically what technological needs must be built for food trucks and make it happen.

I manage a team of developers & designers, ensuring we are moving at a rapid & innovative pace. As a tech company, our edge will always be the power behind our product. User Growth is heavily aligned with creating and implementing strategies in existing markets to increase performance along every aspect of our platforms.
